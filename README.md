# The Website

This personal website is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and is hosted (obviously) by GitHub pages. The [BlackDoc](https://github.com/karloespiritu/BlackDoc) template was initially used as the basis for the design of the website. It is released under a MIT license. I have modified the initially template considereably and have personalized the design. You can check it out [here](http://cakoch10.github.io/)
